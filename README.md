# SQL-dump-to-Json

At the top of the file, there is two variables:
```
Json_file = "database.json"
sql_file = "traceforum.sql"
indent = 0 # little file with no indentation and no \n. intent > 0 = bigger file
```
Change these to what you want, and have fun.

This script should be able to handle any sql creation script, storing all CREATE and INSERT commands.
I made it because I needed it for a university practical work, and I was like, oh, it's pretty good, let's share it, I found nothing good on the internet for this
